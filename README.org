* Goal
  learn how basis sets work and how to represent them in quantum
  chemistry programs. maybe use this knowledge to build a quantum
  chemistry program

* Plan
  Planning to use the [[https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master/Project%2303][Crawford Programming Projects]] as a starting point,
  with Project 3, Hartree-Fock, in particular. I think I should be able
  to reproduce their integrals if I interpret the basis sets
  correctly. Those will be the test cases for the code

** TODO figure out how to compute the integrals
   - is it just the product or do I actually have to integrate?
   - I think you do have to integrate, but the fact that we use
     gaussian orbitals means there is a closed-form solution
   - [[pdf:refs/goings.pdf][this is a great resource]]
   - [[file:refs/ho.pdf][this one looks good too]]

** TODO implement them with [[https://realpython.com/python-testing/#writing-your-first-test][TDD in Python]]

* Weird stuff
